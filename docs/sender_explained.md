# sender.py - File Upload Manager

## 📋 Overview

**File:** `client/sender.py`  
**Purpose:** Monitor for new JSON files and upload them to the server  
**Role:** Consumer in the producer-consumer architecture  
**Runs as:** Standalone process (does NOT require admin privileges)

---

## 🎯 What It Does

`sender.py` is responsible for file monitoring and server communication:

1. **Monitors** `logs/pending_upload/` folder for new files every 1 second
2. **Detects** JSON files with `.ready` markers (signals file is complete)
3. **Reads** JSON file directly (no conversion needed)
4. **Uploads** to server via HTTP POST to `/ingest`
5. **Retries** failed uploads 3 times with exponential backoff
6. **Manages** files:
   - Success → Move to `logs/processed/`
   - Failure → Move to `logs/failed_uploads/`
7. **Auto-retries** failed uploads every 5 minutes

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
logs/pending_upload/
├── packets_20251129_220000.json       ← Sniffer writes here
└── packets_20251129_220000.json.ready ← Ready marker
       ↓
    (sender.py detects)
       ↓
   Read JSON file directly
       ↓
   HTTP POST to /ingest
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┬──────────────┐
  ↓ Success     ↓ Failure      ↓
Move to         Move to        
processed/      failed_uploads/
```

## 🔧 Key Components

### **1. Configuration (Lines 18-33)**

```python
# Folder paths
PENDING_DIR = LOGS_DIR / 'pending_upload'   # Watch this folder
FAILED_DIR = LOGS_DIR / 'failed_uploads'    # Failed uploads
PROCESSED_DIR = LOGS_DIR / 'processed'      # Successful uploads

# Server configuration
SERVER_URL = "http://26.178.118.134:8000/ingest"
POLL_INTERVAL = 1   # Check for new files every 1 second
MAX_RETRIES = 3     # Retry failed uploads 3 times
RETRY_DELAY = 5     # Wait 5 seconds before retry
BATCH_SIZE = 1000   # Upload 1000 packets per HTTP request (optimal for PostgreSQL)
```

**What you can change:**

| Variable | Default | Purpose | Effect of Changing |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `SERVER_URL` | `http://...` | Server endpoint | Point to different server |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | 2 seconds | Check frequency | Lower = faster detection, higher CPU |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | 3 | Upload attempts | Higher = more resilient, slower failures |
| `RETRY_DELAY` | 5 seconds | Delay between retries | Higher = less server load |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 500 | Packets per request | Larger = fewer requests, bigger payloads |

---

**Function:** `read_json_file(json_path)`

**Purpose:** Read JSON file and return list of packet dictionaries

**The Advantage (vs old CSV):**
JSON files preserve types natively - no string conversion needed:
```python
def read_json_file(json_path):
    with open(json_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        packets = json.load(f)  # Already proper types!
    return packets
```

**The Solution:**
```python
def read_csv_file(csv_path):
    # Read CSV
    with open(csv_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        packets = list(reader)
    
    # Convert types
    for packet in packets:
        for key, value in packet.items():
            # Boolean conversion
            if value == 'True':
                packet[key] = True
            elif value == 'False':
                packet[key] = False
            
            # None conversion
            elif value == 'None' or value == '':
                packet[key] = None
            
            # Integer conversion for port numbers, etc.
            elif key in ['length', 'src_port', 'dst_port', ...]:
                packet[key] = int(value) if value else None
            
            # Float conversion for timestamp
            elif key == 'timestamp':
                packet[key] = float(value)
```

**Result:** Proper Python types for server API

---

### **3. Upload Logic (Lines 76-107)**

**Function:** `upload_packets(packets, retry_count=0)`

**Purpose:** Send packet data to server via HTTP POST

```python
def upload_packets(packets, retry_count=0):
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            SERVER_URL,
            json=packets,              # Auto-converts to JSON
            timeout=30,                # 30 second timeout
            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            logger.info(f"✓ Successfully uploaded {len(packets)} packets")
            return True
        else:
            logger.error(f"Server error: {response.status_code}")
            return False
    
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        logger.error("Cannot connect to server")
        return False
    
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        logger.error("Request timed out")
        return False
```

**HTTP Request Example:**
```http
POST /ingest_packets HTTP/1.1
Host: 26.178.118.134:8000
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "timestamp": 1701234567.123,
    "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "dst_ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    ...
  },
  {
    "timestamp": 1701234567.456,
    ...
  }
]
```

---

### **4. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff (Lines 109-123)**

**Function:** `upload_with_retry(packets)`

**Purpose:** Automatically retry failed uploads

```python
def upload_with_retry(packets):
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):  # 3 attempts
        if upload_packets(packets, retry_count=attempt):
            return True  # Success!
        
        if attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1:
            # Exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s
            delay = RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** attempt)
            logger.info(f"Retrying in {delay} seconds...")
            time.sleep(delay)
    
    return False  # All retries failed
```

**Retry Timeline:**
```
Attempt 1: Upload fails
    ↓ Wait 5 seconds
Attempt 2: Upload fails
    ↓ Wait 10 seconds
Attempt 3: Upload fails
    ↓
Give up, move to failed_uploads/
```

**Why exponential backoff?**
- Gives server time to recover
- Reduces load on struggling server
- Industry best practice

---

### **5. File Processing Pipeline (Lines 125-180)**

**Function:** `process_csv_file(csv_path)`

**Purpose:** Complete workflow for one CSV file

**Flow:**

```python
1. Check for .ready marker
   if not ready_marker.exists():
       return False  # Skip incomplete files
   ↓
2. Read CSV file
   packets = read_csv_file(csv_path)
   ↓
3. Upload in batches (if large file)
   for i in range(0, total_packets, BATCH_SIZE):
       batch = packets[i:i + BATCH_SIZE]
       upload_with_retry(batch)
   ↓
4. Move file based on result
   if success:
       csv_path.rename(PROCESSED_DIR / csv_path.name)
   else:
       csv_path.rename(FAILED_DIR / csv_path.name)
```

**Why batching?**
- Large CSV might have 10,000+ packets
- Uploading in one request = huge payload
- Split into 500-packet batches = manageable

**Example:**
```
File with 2,000 packets:
  Batch 1: Packets 0-499    → Upload
  Batch 2: Packets 500-999  → Upload
  Batch 3: Packets 1000-1499 → Upload
  Batch 4: Packets 1500-1999 → Upload
```

---

### **6. Failed Upload Retry (Lines 182-207)**

**Function:** `retry_failed_uploads()`

**Purpose:** Periodically retry previously failed uploads

```python
def retry_failed_uploads():
    # Find all failed uploads
    failed_files = list(FAILED_DIR.glob('packets_*.csv'))
    
    if not failed_files:
        return  # Nothing to retry
    
    logger.info(f"Retrying {len(failed_files)} failed uploads...")
    
    for failed_file in failed_files:
        packets = read_csv_file(failed_file)
        
        if upload_with_retry(packets):
            # Success! Move to processed
            failed_file.rename(PROCESSED_DIR / failed_file.name)
            logger.info(f"✓ Retry successful")
        else:
            # Still failing, leave in failed_uploads/
            logger.warning(f"✗ Retry failed")
```

**When called:**
- On startup: Retry all existing failed uploads
- Every 5 minutes: Automatic retry

---

### **7. Main Monitoring Loop (Lines 209-247)**

**Function:** `monitor_and_upload()`

**Purpose:** Continuously watch for new files

```python
def monitor_and_upload():
    last_retry_check = datetime.now()
    
    while True:  # Forever loop
        # 1. Find CSV files with .ready markers
        csv_files = []
        for ready_file in PENDING_DIR.glob('*.ready'):
            csv_file = ready_file.with_suffix('')  # Remove .ready
            if csv_file.exists() and csv_file.suffix == '.csv':
                csv_files.append(csv_file)
        
        # 2. Process in chronological order
        csv_files.sort()
        for csv_file in csv_files:
            process_csv_file(csv_file)
        
        # 3. Periodic retry of failed uploads (every 5 min)
        if (datetime.now() - last_retry_check).seconds > 300:
            retry_failed_uploads()
            last_retry_check = datetime.now()
        
        # 4. Wait before next check
        time.sleep(POLL_INTERVAL)  # 2 seconds
```

**Timeline:**
```
00:00 - Check for files → Process any found
00:02 - Check for files → None found
00:04 - Check for files → Process 1 file
00:05 - Retry failed uploads (5 min mark)
00:06 - Check for files → None found
...
```

## 📊 Data Flow Example

**Scenario:** Uploading 1 CSV file with 150 packets

```
1. sniffer.py saves:
   logs/pending_upload/packets_20251129_220000.csv
   logs/pending_upload/packets_20251129_220000.csv.ready

2. sender.py (every 2 seconds):
   - Scans pending_upload/
   - Finds .ready marker
   - process_csv_file() called

3. Read CSV:
   packets = [
     {timestamp: 1701234567.123, src_ip: "192.168.1.1", ...},
     {timestamp: 1701234567.456, src_ip: "192.168.1.2", ...},
     ... (150 packets total)
   ]

4. Upload (no batching needed, < 500 packets):
   POST /ingest_packets
   JSON: [150 packets]

5. Server responds: 200 OK

6. Success! Move file:
   mv packets_20251129_220000.csv → logs/processed/
   rm packets_20251129_220000.csv.ready

7. Log: "✓ packets_20251129_220000.csv processed successfully (150 packets)"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Examples

### Change Upload Frequency
```python
POLL_INTERVAL = 5  # Check every 5 seconds instead of 2
```
**Effect:** Lower CPU usage, but slightly higher latency

### Increase Retry Attempts
```python
MAX_RETRIES = 5  # Try 5 times instead of 3
```
**Effect:** More resilient, but slower to fail

### Reduce Batch Size (For Slower Networks)
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 100  # Smaller batches
```
**Effect:** Smaller HTTP payloads, but more requests

### Change Server URL
```python
SERVER_URL = "http://192.168.1.10:8000/ingest_packets"
```
**Effect:** Upload to different server

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check if Running
```bash
ps aux | grep sender.py
```

### View Live Output
```bash
python sender.py
# Output shows:
# - Files being processed
# - Upload success/failure
# - Retry attempts
```

### Check File Counts
```bash
# Pending uploads (waiting)
ls logs/pending_upload/*.csv | wc -l

# Processed (successful)
ls logs/processed/*.csv | wc -l

# Failed (need retry)
ls logs/failed_uploads/*.csv | wc -l
```

### Tail Logs
```bash
# Watch sender.py output in real-time
python sender.py 2>&1 | tee sender.log
tail -f sender.log
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Files Being Uploaded
**Checks:**
1. Is sniffer.py running and creating files?
   ```bash
   ls logs/pending_upload/
   ```

2. Are `.ready` markers present?
   ```bash
   ls logs/pending_upload/*.ready
   ```

3. Can you reach the server?
   ```bash
   curl http://26.178.118.134:8000/health
   ```

---

### Connection Errors
```
ERROR: Connection error (attempt 1/3)
```

**Causes:**
- Server not running
- Wrong SERVER_URL
- Firewall blocking connection
- Network issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check server is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://SERVER_IP:8000/health
   ```

2. Verify SERVER_URL in sender.py matches server

3. Check firewall allows port 8000

---

### Files Stuck in failed_uploads/
**Cause:** Server consistently rejecting or timing out

**Debug:**
1. Manually upload one file:
   ```python
   import requests
   packets = [...]  # From CSV
   response = requests.post(SERVER_URL, json=packets)
   print(response.status_code, response.text)
   ```

2. Check server logs for errors

3. Verify CSV format matches server expectations

---

### High CPU Usage
**Cause:** POLL_INTERVAL too low

**Solution:**
```python
POLL_INTERVAL = 5  # Check every 5 seconds
```

---

### Duplicate Uploads
**This should NOT happen** due to atomic file moves

**If it does:**
- Check for race conditions in sniffer.py
- Ensure only one sender.py process running:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep sender.py
  # Should see only 1 process
  ```

---

## 💡 Performance Tips

### For Large Files (>10,000 packets)
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # Larger batches
```

### For Slow Networks
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 100   # Smaller batches
timeout=60         # Increase timeout in upload_packets()
```

### For High-Latency Networks
```python
RETRY_DELAY = 10   # Wait longer between retries
MAX_RETRIES = 5    # More attempts
```

---

## 📁 File Organization

sender.py manages three directories:

### **pending_upload/**
- Files waiting to be uploaded
- Created by sniffer.py
- Continuously monitored

### **processed/**
- Successfully uploaded files
- Kept for audit trail
- Can be deleted after X days:
  ```bash
  find logs/processed -name "*.csv" -mtime +7 -delete
  ```

### **failed_uploads/**
- Files that couldn't be uploaded
- Auto-retried every 5 minutes
- Manual retry: restart sender.py

---

## 🎯 Summary

**sender.py is designed to:**
✅ Continuously monitor for new files  
✅ Upload data reliably with retries  
✅ Handle network failures gracefully  
✅ Prevent data loss (move to processed/failed)  
✅ Auto-retry failed uploads  
✅ Batch large files for efficiency  
✅ Run independently from sniffer  

**It does NOT:**
❌ Capture packets (that's sniffer.py's job)  
❌ Process or aggregate data (that's aggregator.py's job)  
❌ Run ML predictions (that's aggregator.py's job)  

**Next step:** Ensure server (`main.py`) is running to receive uploads.
